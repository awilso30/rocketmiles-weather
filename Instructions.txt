Hello!

Rocketmiles is proud to call Chicago home, but as you may know it’s important to watch the weather. One day may be sunny and the next may be six inches of snow.

We’d like a single page web app that displays a weather forecast. Ideally your app will get today's weather and the next 5 days. We travel a lot here at Rocketmiles so we'd love to be able to search for any destination and see the forecast for wherever we might end up next.

Some guidelines before you get started:

- Write your app using standard Angular 1.x conventions.
- Your application should run flawlessly in the latest version of Chrome.
- We'd like to see the forecast populated when the user first enters your app with their current location. Should the user decline to offer their location, default to our office in the 60661 zip code.
- We use CSS every single day and we value thoughtful presentation. You certainly don’t have to animate or draw to Canvas, but a little polish goes a long way.
- It’s reasonable to have the browser refresh to fetch new data, it’s better if it doesn’t.
- We recommend using this API: http://openweathermap.org
- We highly value well tested code.

What to send us

- A github repository link to your project
- A readme with instructions on how to run your app.

Please try to have the project done within 48 hours. We respect your time and understand that you probably have competing priorities. If that is the case please let us know. We'd be happy to extend the timeframe!

We look forward to seeing what you create!
